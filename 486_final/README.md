Title: Rock Climbing and Socioeconomic Equity: Arizona
Data Required: Arizona state boundaries shapefile; Arizona Census Tract data including race, income, and education data from the 2014 and 2019 ACS5 surveys; Point data for popular rock climbing sites genererated from spreadsheets downloaded from www.mountainproject.com
Analysis: This project will aim to assess the demographic makeup of census tracts which are in close proximity to known rock climbing sites. Previous research has demonstrated that rock climbers are typically white males with college education and above-average income, while climbing-related touristic activity has been linked to economic improvement within communities surrounding popular climbing sites (Maples et al., 2019; Carter, 2020). The analysis therefore aims to explore whether any differences between the typical American rock climber demographic and those who live in the areas surrounding climbing sites, as well as to look for any potential socioeconomic impacts that climbing activity has had in these communities.
Outputs: (1) A map showing all census tracts in AZ which have rock climbing sites, symbolized by concentration of climbing sites
(2) A series of bivariate change over time maps of these census tracts displaying changes in (1) local demographic diversity (2) individual income (3) population with university degrees.
(3) A series of order of least square regression analyses assessing any correlations between the presence of climbing sites and the three aforementioned variables.
(4)An interactive webmap showing
