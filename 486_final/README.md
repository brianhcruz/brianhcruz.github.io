Title: Rock Climbing and Socioeconomic Equity: Arizona
Data Required: Arizona state boundaries shapefile; Arizona Census Tract data including race, income, and education data from the 2014 and 2019 ACS5 surveys; Point data for popular rock climbing sites genererated from spreadsheets downloaded from www.mountainproject.com
Analysis: This project will aim to assess the demographic makeup of census tracts which are in close proximity to known rock climbing sites. Previous research has demonstrated that rock climbers are typically white males with college education and above-average income, while climbing-related touristic activity has been linked to economic improvement within communities surrounding popular climbing sites (Maples et al., 2019; Carter, 2020). This project therefore aims to 
Outputs: (1)A 
(2)A map examinig correlations between the presence and density of climbing locations in census tracts at risk of being subject to land-use conflicts with Arizona Tribal communities
(3)A combined overall climber priority area raster map of the entire state of Arizona.
