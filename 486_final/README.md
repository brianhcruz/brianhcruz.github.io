## Title: Rock Climbing and Socioeconomic Equity: Arizona

## Data Required: 
Arizona state boundaries shapefile; Arizona Census Tract data including race, income, and education data from the 2014 and 2019 ACS5 surveys; Point data for popular rock climbing sites genererated from spreadsheets downloaded from www.mountainproject.com <br>
## Analysis: 
This project will aim to assess the demographic makeup of census tracts which are in close proximity to known rock climbing sites. Previous research has demonstrated that rock climbers are typically white males with college education and above-average income, while climbing-related touristic activity has been linked to economic improvement within communities surrounding popular climbing sites (Maples et al., 2019; Carter et al., 2020). The analysis therefore aims to explore any differences between the typical American rock climber demographic and those who live in the areas surrounding climbing sites, as well as to look for any potential socioeconomic impacts that climbing activity has had in these communities.
## Outputs: 
# (1) 
One map showing all census tracts in Arizona which have rock climbing sites symbolized by concentration of climbing sites and one map showing the census tracts symbolized by Simpson's diversity index for the 2015 - 2019 ACS5 survey.
## (2)
A series of bivariate maps of Arizona's census tracts displaying (1) local demographic diversity, (2) median individual income, (3) population percentages with bachelor's degrees as they relate to rock climbing sites.
## (3) 
A series of T Tests of Independence and order of least square regression analyses assessing any correlations between the presence of climbing sites and the three aforementioned variables.
## (4)
An interactive bivariate webmap showing all of this data at the census tract level for the 2015 - 2019 survey period.
