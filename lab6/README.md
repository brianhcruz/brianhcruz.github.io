# Exploring the Relationships between Poverty and Energy Production Facilities in Wyoming

# Introduction
Inspired by a recent [New York Times Daily Podcast Episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/podcasts/the-daily/wind-power-wyoming-climate-change.html), this project
aimed to explore the relationships between poverty levels and local energy production facilities, focusing on wind energy production sites.

# Data
Data on estimates of numbers of people who have earned income below the federal poverty line and was sourced from the [United States Census Bureau's 5-Year American Community Surveys](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html), while
point data on power generation plants was sourced from the [Wyomigng Geospatial Hub](https://data.geospatialhub.org/datasets/63934a36caea4bfeb97a7d7aa021daad_0?geometry=-116.070%2C41.634%2C-99.382%2C44.444). 


# Processing & Transformations
Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data? Explain your R code or your steps in QGIS.

Percentages of county populations who earned incomes below the poverty line in the ACS5 periods of study had to be calculated. This was done in R by downloading the total population estimates of the counties along with the estimates of 


# Analysis
What did you learn? What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets? You may need to explain some of your R code not explained above.


# Results

What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class? Explain your bin folder.
