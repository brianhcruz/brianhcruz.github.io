## Storytelling for the twenty-first century

Digital storytelling is a powerful tool that is receiving growing attention in the fields of education, community development, public health, psychology, and archival sciences. Digital stories are creative short films that present highly personal accounts of lessons learned, formative experiences, and everyday life, all narrated by the filmmaker. Part of my [Shriver Peaceworker fellowship](https://shrivercenter.umbc.edu/peaceworker/) involved taking a course on digital storytelling and producing two digital stories: one about my Peace Corps service, and one about my time as a graduate student.
