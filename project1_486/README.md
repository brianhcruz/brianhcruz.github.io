## Title: Access Risk Assessment for Arizona Rock Climbing Sites<br>
## Data Required: 
Arizona state boundaries shapefile with data on cities and road networks (sourced from AZ state open data portal);
point data for popular rock climbing sites generated from API's from www.mountainproject.com; 
point data for Arizona's current copper mining sites; point data for arizona's known copper deposits
## Analysis: 
This project will aim to identify known climbing areas in Arizona which may be under threat of degradation due to local copper mining activity.<br>
The main output of this analysis will be an interactive web-map showing risk-ratings for every known climbing site in the state based on their proximity to known or potential copper mines.
