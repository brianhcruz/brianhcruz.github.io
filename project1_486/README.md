Title: Access Risk Assessment for Arizona Rock Climbing Sites<br>
Data Required: Arizona state boundaries shapefile with data on cities and road networks (sourced from AZ state open data portal);
shapefiles for Tribal Lands (sourced from BIA open data portal);
point data for popular rock climbing sites generated from API's from www.mountainproject.com<br>
Analysis: This project will aim to identify priority areas for the Arizona climbing community to develop anticipatory best practices to maintain access to established
rock climbing areas. These will be based on (1) network analyses to determine which climbing areas are most easily accessible to population centers (e.g., within 50 miles) and
(2) identifying climbing areas that are near or on Tribal lands. The logic behind these is that areas near urban centers will receive greater traffic and thus exposure to environmental degradation from excessive use, which may drive local stakeholders and land managers to restrict climbing access. On the other hand, outdoor recreation is regularly a source of conflict with Indigenous stakeholders and has been one of the main drivers of the loss of climbing access and straining of relationships with Tribal communities.<br>
Outputs: (1)A network-analysis map showing climbing locations at risk of environmental degradation<br>
         (2)A map showing climbing locations at risk of being subject to land-use conflicts with Arizona Tribal communities<br>
         (3)A combined overall climber priority area raster map of the entire state of Arizona.
